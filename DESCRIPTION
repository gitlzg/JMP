Description: Includes the application of a semiparametric joint model for terminal trend of quality of life (QOL) and survival. For longitudinal QOL outcomes, a semiparametric mixed effects submodel (only random intercept is included in this package) is used. In addition, a cox submodel is used to model survival outcomes.
